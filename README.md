Web based application for displaying Life Support Environment data as a web page for Challenger Learning Center

NOTE from Steve Berl on 9/26/2023:
Since the Challenger Learning Center at Chabot Space and Science Center in Oakland, CA, USA has closed and been dismantled, the function of this repository is no longer relevant. So I am archiving this repository.


This is a combination of python, HTML, and Javascript.
There is a web application that runs under the apache web server mod_wsgi module
Then there is a python/Flask component that runs when the server is called
There are 2 browser screens. One for the commander and one for the station.
